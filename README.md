## üîß Project Info & Known Issues

This repository contains two Android projects developed as part of my learning journey in Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- **Chatbot functionality** is currently not working. It was originally integrated using a third-party website that offered limited-time free access. You are free to replace it with your own chatbot service or integrate a different solution.

- **User detail input screen issue**: On the first screen, if the user doesn't enter any details and presses "Next", it still navigates to the next screen. This can be easily fixed by adding a simple conditional check before navigation. I left this intentionally unfinished due to time constraints.

- **UI Responsiveness**: The overall UI is designed with my personal device dimensions in mind. While most screens work well across different devices, the **home screen layout may not fit properly** on all screen sizes. I tried to make it responsive, but some improvements are still needed.

### üå± Developer's Note:

These are early-stage projects where I focused on functionality and learning key Android concepts. With each project, I aim to improve ‚Äî especially in UI design, code structure, and handling edge cases. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

I'm confident that future versions will be more polished and responsive across all screen sizes. Thank you for checking out my work!
